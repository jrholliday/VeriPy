There are many different types of forecasts, and each type requires its own methods of testing and verification. Similarly, for a given forecast there are many different types of tests which can be performed, and the forecast may perform differently on different tests. Care must be taken to chose an appropriate test and to interpret the results correctly. This package attempts to create a standard set of tools for use in general verifications of generic forecast data sets.
